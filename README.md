SparkAI is a mobile app that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide users with advanced natural language processing capabilities.

**NOTE:** Open AI library is not for free. There is a small monthly limit that I can afford to provide access to everyone.

However, whenit is over the service stops for everyone until the next month bill cicle.
          
**I have to introduce soon a pay option to cover the cost of Open AI library use.**

With SparkAI, users can interact with a conversational AI that can perform tasks such as answering questions, generating text, and providing language translations. 

The app can also analyze text to provide sentiment analysis, summarize long-form content, and generate writing prompts. 

By leveraging OpenAI's powerful artificial intelligence capabilities, SparkAI offers a unique and innovative way for users to engage with and utilize natural language processing technology.
